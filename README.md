A binary search tree (BST) has the property that a node is greater than its left child, and less than its right child (of course, we mean value associated with a node). 
In this project, we will check whether a binary tree is a BST or not. a prototype function is already provided in bst.c, namely, is_bst( struct binary_tree *t ), which should not be modified in any way, another prototype function called is_bst_recursive( struct node *t, int *flag), is the one that actually performs the job.  The basic idea is: we compare a node with its left and right child, if the BST property keeps, we further proceed to its left child ( if it exists ) and right child (if it exists), in a similary manner, by calling is_bst_recursive recurivelly, otherwise, we set the state in flag, and return from the function. As the function is recursively called, so once enter the fuction one should immediately examine, whether *flag is zero or not, if not, return from the function directly, without other processing.
One is required to write code in is_bst_recursive( struct node *t, int *flag ) to impelement the job.
In main.c, one can write code to test the implementation.
Other files, defs.h, tree.h, and tree.c should not be modified in any cicrumstances.
For submission, only bst.c is needed.
